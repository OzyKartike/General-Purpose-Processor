Entity latch IS
	Port ( A: IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0); -- 8 bit A input
			 resetn, Clock : IN STD_LOGIC; -- 1 bit block input and 1 bit reset input bit
			 Q : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0));
			 
End latch;
ARCHITECTURE Behavior OF latch IS
Begin
	Process(resetn, Clock) -- process tkes reset and clock as inputs
	Begin	IF Resetn = '0' THEN -- when reset input is '0' thelatches does not operate
			Q <= "00000000";
		ElseIF Clock'EVENT AND Clock = '1' THEN -- level sensitive baed on clock	
			Q <= A;
		END IF;
	END Process;
End Behavior;
